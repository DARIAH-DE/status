# What's This?

This subdirectory contains status notifications for the textgrid repository. Look at 
https://wiki.de.dariah.eu/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=TGINT&title=Repository-Status-Meldung
for details.

# Attention

The notification parser from textgridlab will show the first element with class status. So make sure to have only one status snippet active and comment out the rest (or make at least sure that the top element with status class is the wanted message ;-)).
