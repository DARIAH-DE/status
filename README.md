# DARIAH-DE Status #

This is the DARIAH-DE Status page, served under [https://dariah-de.github.io/status/](https://dariah-de.github.io/status/).

The status page is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using its features for [Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) and [Data Files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) to keep track of the infrastructure and its status.

## How it works

See the [documentation](documentation.md).

To compile the graph, you need `graphviz` and the python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Development

To test the functionally locally, do

```
bundle install
```

and 

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
